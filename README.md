- This project is a "file search engine" built in Python.
- The program was built by PyQt5 GUI.
- The user enters the directory where he\she wants to search in, and the word or the phrase to search about.
- The program looks only in ".txt" files, and in the specified directory, and it doesn't search in the sub-directories.
